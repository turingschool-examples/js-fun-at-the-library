// Read the instructions for each of the warm up exercises carefully. This may
// seem repetitious or pedantic at first, however it's very important that you
// become comfortable with these fundamental concepts. Do not move on to
// iteration 1 until you are confident that you've completed all of iteration 0.


//------------------------- Variables -------------------------//


// Initialize two new variables, "title", and "pages", and assign values to them with
// a book's title and page count.

// var title = "Harry Potter";
// var ...



// Reassign (not initialize) your "pages" variable from above. An editor came around and
// condensed the book, use a built in math operator to make the page count a quarter
// of what it currently is 



// Initialize a new variable "movie", but leave it undefined



// Create a variable named "sequel", and assign it to a be a sequel of your
// book (made up or not!). Your sequel must make use of your "title" variable from above



// Initialize a new variable "isFavorite", and assign it to a boolean value indicating
// if the book you chose is your favorite book or not




// Create a new variable named "isShortStory", and use a comparison operator to
// assign a boolean value to this variable. If "pages" is less than 25, the
// variable should be true, otherwise it should be false. You MUST use a
// comparison operator.



//------------------------- Conditionals -------------------------//


// Express the following in code: If the variable "pages" is less than 1000 log
// the statement 'I could read that in a day!', otherwise, log the statement 
// 'Ok, maybe I could read that in a day and a half'



// Express the following in code: If the variable "isFavorite" is true,
// log the statement 'My favorite book is [title]!'. Otherwise, log the
// statement 'I recently read the [title] book'. In either case, the value stored in
// the "title" variable should be included in the logged statement.



//------------------------- Arrays -------------------------//


// Create a new variable "books" and assign it to an Array of 5 different
// book titles, represented by their names as Strings.


// Write the code to access the 3rd element of the Array, using bracket
// notation.


// Create a new variable "belowTwoHundred" and assign it to an Array of 12
// different numbers below two hundred.


// Write the code to access the 5th element of the array, using bracket notation.


//------------------------- Objects -------------------------//

// Create a new variable "dictionary" and assign to it an object literal with two
// keys: name, and hasThesaurus. The value for name should the string 'Webster's', and
// the value for hasThesaurus should be false


// Write the code to add the key of pageCount, with the value of 720. Use dot
// notation to do this. DO NOT modify your code from above.
